    "- This file should not be considered a final or polished script, but rather a record of the exploratory work that went into building the scraper. It may contain incomplete code, tests, and notes that were used to understand the structure of the eCitizen platform and how to extract relevant data effectively.\n",
    "- All scraped pages are saved as HTML files in the `pages/` subdirectory relative to this notebook, and the code snippets here are part of the process of understanding how to retrieve and parse those pages."
