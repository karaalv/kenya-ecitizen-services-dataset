    "\n",
    "- This notebook contains the post processing analysis of the Kenya eCitizen Services Dataset. It includes insights derived from the dataset that are used to better understand the results of the data collection.\n",
    "- Note that the source data is clean and does not require any cleaning or preprocessing. The analysis focuses on deriving insights from the clean dataset.\n",
    "- For further insights into the data collection process, please refer to the [Data Collection Methodology](../planning/methodology.md) document.\n",
    "- Furthermore, to view insights related to each entity in the dataset, please refer to the [Entity Insights](../data/insights/) folder which contains detailed insights for each entity."

    "- From the insights obtained during the data collection process, we observed that very few fields were missing across the dataset. This indicates that the data collection process was thorough and effective in capturing the necessary information for each entity.\n",
    "- We note that any missing fields were not due to data collection errors but rather due to the information not being available on the website at the time of data collection. This suggests that the dataset is comprehensive and accurately reflects the information available on the eCitizen portal.\n",
    "- Manual inspection revealed that information such as metadata for the `Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO)` agency and ministry descriptions for the `Ministry of Health` and `Ministry Of Public Service, Gender And Affirmative Action` were not available on the website. This highlights the importance of manual inspection in identifying gaps in the dataset and ensuring that it accurately represents the information available on the eCitizen portal.\n",
    "- Despite these few missing fields, over **99%** of the dataset is complete, demonstrating the robustness of the data collection process.\n",
    "- Additionally, no duplicates were found in the dataset, further confirming the quality and reliability of the collected data."
